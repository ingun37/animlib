# Pre-built binaries of some plugins are shipped with Maya. We don't
# want to build them by default with all the others because then there
# would be two versions of the same plugin and unless you know exactly
# what you are doing the wrong one might get loaded.
#
# The top-level makefile of the devkit won't recurse by default into
# the sub-directory of prebuilt plugins. So if you want to build one
# of these you must do so explicitly by invoking make from the given
# sub-directory or invoke the prebuiltPlugins rules from the top-level
# makefile.

# The top-level makefile of the devkit won't recurse by default into
# the sub-directory of plugins depending on third-party components. So
# if you want to build one of these you must do so explicitly by
# invoking make from the given sub-directory or invoke the
# thirdPartyPlugins rules from the top-level makefile. For example:
